This project is an smaller OpenGL-like renderer implemented from scratch in C++. It provides basic functionality for rendering 3D graphics such as face models. The intention of the project is to show the intersection of mathematics and programming in everyday use cases.

- main.cpp: Contains the main function and example usage.
- model.cpp / model.h: Handles object file reading to then translate data into a proper image.
- tgaimage.cpp / tgaimage.h: Handles TGA image loading and output.
- geometry.h / geometry.cpp: Contains vector and matrix operations.
    - Cross product vector manipulation to showcase lightning.
